,,"As the number of system users grows, a threat actor who comrpomises an account with high privielege can re-enable legitimate users and take on their identity - rather than needing to create a new user account",is supported by,"There is no formal JML process and accounts are disabled, not removed",indicates failure of,Identity and access management
,,,,"There is no formal JML process and accounts are disabled, not removed",indicates failure of,Policy and standards
Disruption to teams productivity,can arise due to exploit of,"If code is deleted accidentally or malicously, there is no single time of 'last complete backup', or knowledge of who has the most recent code base ",is supported by,Code is only backed up locally to developer laptops,indicates failure of,Continuity and disaster recovery
Missed targets and deadlines,can arise due to exploit of,"If code is deleted accidentally or malicously, there is no single time of 'last complete backup', or knowledge of who has the most recent code base ",is supported by,Code is only backed up locally to developer laptops,indicates failure of,Continuity and disaster recovery
Material drop in profit margin,can arise due to exploit of,"If code is deleted accidentally or malicously, there is no single time of 'last complete backup', or knowledge of who has the most recent code base ",is supported by,Code is only backed up locally to developer laptops,indicates failure of,Continuity and disaster recovery
Missed targets and deadlines,can arise due to exploit of,"Technical vulnerabilities can be introduced through code, and remain undetected, enabling threat actors to find and exploit them, and increasing downstream costs",is supported by,No formal security code review has been performed ,indicates failure of,Asset intelligence
,,,,No formal security code review has been performed ,indicates failure of,Secure engineering
Inability to avoid future recurrence,can arise due to exploit of,An external threat actor can launch a brute force attack to discover credentials for the application direct from the internet,is supported by,"There is no authentication gateway (e.g. VPN, SSO) for this applicaiton",indicates failure of,Secure architecture
,,,,"There is no authentication gateway (e.g. VPN, SSO) for this applicaiton",indicates failure of,Secure engineering
Increased time to detect,can arise due to exploit of,Custom or commodity malware can be created or adapted to bypass AV detection at a low level of threat actor sophistication,is supported by,Laptops used for this project only have standard AV installed,indicates failure of,Secure engineering
,,,,Laptops used for this project only have standard AV installed,indicates failure of,Security capability testing
Delayed fulfilment of services,can arise due to exploit of,"Due to loss of repudiation, if a threat actor gains access to the API key, it would not be possble to know if or what data they accessed through APIs",is supported by,API keys are stored in plain text on user devices,indicates failure of,Secure engineering
,,,,API keys are stored in plain text on user devices,indicates failure of,Secure engineering
Disruption to teams productivity,can arise due to exploit of,"If a threat actor gains access to the API key, access cannot be restricted and the key needs to be reset, which will impact any dependent services ",is supported by,API keys are stored in plain text on user devices,indicates failure of,Identity and access management
,,,,"Password re-sets for Sunways need to be done manually, one by one, by an admin user",indicates failure of,Secure engineering
,,,,Admin accounts for Sunways are shared across users,indicates failure of,Identity and access management
Increased time to detect,can arise due to exploit of,"Digicorp does not have visiblity into attacks against users that fail, so there is no early warning system of an uptick in attacks attempting to compromise user accounts or credentials",is supported by,"Several user accounts have logs that suggest failed brute force attacks. ALee has the same pattern, followed by a login they do not recognise.",indicates failure of,Detection Engineering
,,,,"Several user accounts have logs that suggest failed brute force attacks. ALee has the same pattern, followed by a login they do not recognise.",,
