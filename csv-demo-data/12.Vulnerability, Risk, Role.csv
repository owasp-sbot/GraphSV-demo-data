"In the event of another incident, or a requirement for architecture change, there is no person who can make a final decision on the impact or appropriateness of the change",requires decision about,"In the next quarter, there is no point of contact who can advise on how quickly vulnerabilities can be fixed or mitigated, or whether the application will need taking down. The expected loss due to this control gap is <$1M if a similar incident occurs.",owned by,SVP - Special Projects
"In the event of another incident, Security will have a 5 hour lag before they can establish (or rule out) which user account may have been compromised, or been used by a legitimate user to act maliciously",requires decision about,"In the next quarter, if a threat actor of moderate sophistication compromises an account, Security may not be able to detect potential malicious behaviour for 5 hours in line with the batch extract process for access logs that is currently available. The loss amount from impacts a threat actor can cause is <$1M if disaster recover processes are not improved.",owned by,CISO
"If an internal or external threat actor gains access to Sunways, and acts maliciously to impact confidentiality, integrity or availability of data, there are no logs to evidence what account took what actions",,,,
"As the number of system users grows, a threat actor who comrpomises an account with high privielege can re-enable legitimate users and take on their identity - rather than needing to create a new user account",,,,
"If code is deleted accidentally or malicously, there is no single time of 'last complete backup', or knowledge of who has the most recent code base ",requires decision about,"If a threat actor or employee deletes code deliberately or accidentally, there is currently no control to assure continunity to an SLA, which could lead to losses >$3M depending on when the deletion occurs.",needs raising to,CEO
"Technical vulnerabilities can be introduced through code, and remain undetected, enabling threat actors to find and exploit them, and increasing downstream costs",,,,
An external threat actor can launch a brute force attack to discover credentials for the application direct from the internet,,,,
Custom or commodity malware can be created or adapted to bypass AV detection at a low level of threat actor sophistication,,,,
"Due to loss of repudiation, if a threat actor gains access to the API key, it would not be possble to know if or what data they accessed through APIs",requires decision about,"If a threat actor compromises API keys, the key reset process would take around 3 hours, costing <$2M in worse case based on current API integrations",owned by,Platform Specialist
"If a threat actor gains access to the API key, access cannot be restricted and the key needs to be reset, which will impact any dependent services ",,,,
"Digicorp does not have visiblity into attacks against users that fail, so there is no early warning system of an uptick in attacks attempting to compromise user accounts or credentials",,,,
